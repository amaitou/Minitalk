# Minitalk

Speaking of the projects of `42Cursus`, Minitalk belongs to the third circle in the Cursus. <br/>
This project aims to set up a communication program in the form of a client and a server using signals.

**```Note: I haven't shared the PDF of this project, as well as, I haven't explained anything due to school privacy reasons!```**

# Signals

when it comes to the communication between two processes there are plenty of ways to set up this communication, and here are some of them:
- [Shared memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipc-shared-memory/)
- [Named Pipe or FIFO](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/named-pipe-fifo-example-c-program/)
- [PIPES](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=io-working-pipes)
- [Signal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/signals-c-language/)

This project limites you to use only signals to set up this communication between these two processes (`client` & `server`) by sending a message from the `client` to the server according to that last's process id.

> Your are allowed to use only these two signals **SIGUSR1** and **SIGUSR2**
